Hello there! I'm Ritesh, a Life Sciences Post-Graduate from the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), India. I am currently pursuing the Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the Indian Institute of Management Bodh Gaya, India.  

Transition from Academia to Corporate
------

During my time at NISER, under the guidance of my former Personal Instructor, **Dr. Chandan Goswami**, I focussed learning new in-silico techniques and upscaling my programming skills which led me to be proficient in the domains of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. By the end of my Masters degree at NISER, I realised my deep interest towards data analytics and large data handling, which thanks to my programming proficency made it a breeze to navigate through tiresome troubleshooting. Thus, my new found interest bundled with my curiosity for how Large Businesses use data as their key component in decision-making and my willingness to have a hands-on experience on this topic in the corporate world led me to pursue MBA at IIM Bodh Gaya, as I plan to do my major in IT and Analytics. 

Despite not pursuing PhD. after my MSc. from a pristine research institute like NISER, my passion for computational biology and data analysis keeps fueling my drive to work on various research projects as an independent researcher along with people from other domains.
