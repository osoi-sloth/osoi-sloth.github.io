Hello there! I'm Ritesh, a Life Sciences Post-Graduate from the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), India. I am currently pursuing the Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the Indian Institute of Management Bodh Gaya, India.  

During my time at NISER, under the guidance of my former Personal Instructor, **Dr. Chandan Goswami**, I focussed learning new in-silico techniques and upscaling my programming skills which led me to be proficient in the domains of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. By the end of my Masters degree at NISER, I realised my deep interest towards data analytics and large data handling, which thanks to my programming proficency made it a breeze to navigate through tiresome troubleshooting. Thus, my new found interest bundled with my curiosity for how Large Businesses use data as their key component in decision-making and my willingness to have a hands-on experience on this topic in the corporate world led me to pursue MBA at IIM Bodh Gaya, as I plan to do my major in IT and Analytics. 

Despite not pursuing PhD. after my MSc. from a pristine research institute like NISER, my passion for computational biology and data analysis keeps fueling my drive to work on various research projects as an independent researcher along with people from other domains.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
------
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
